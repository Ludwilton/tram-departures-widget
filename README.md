# tram-departures-widget
A TTK widget that uses the VÃ¤sttrafik API to keep track of tram departures at the desired GID / Stop.


#### note:  
created this for personal use while learning python, code is probably not robust. 

You can calculate a GID using map coordinates, you will probably not find a list of them online or in the API doc.
